# InfoGraph - PyTorch (PyTorch Geometric) Implementation

This is an unoffical re-implementation of Sun et al.'s **InfoGraph: Unsupervised and Semi-supervised Graph-Level Representation Learning via Mutual Information Maximization** (ICLR 2020).

Official implementation is available [here](https://github.com/fanyun-sun/InfoGraph).

This implementation is basically a cleaned-up and commented version of the official implementation.

## Requirements
 - python 3.7
 - pytorch 1.5.0
 - pytorch-geometric 1.5.0


## Run unsupervised Learning
`python unsupervised.py`
